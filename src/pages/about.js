        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave">Synthwave</a> (also
        called outrun, retrowave, or futuresynth) is an electronic music
        microgenre that is based predominantly on the music associated with
        action, science-fiction, and horror film soundtracks of the 1980s. Other
        influences are drawn from the decade's art and video games. Synthwave
        musicians often espouse nostalgia for 1980s culture and attempt to
        capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.
